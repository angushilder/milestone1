Hog and Truffles

This website was produced to help a small trading company called Hog and Truffles", to provide them with an online presence. They are located near Cardiff, in Wales. The site has been set up, to help show the rest of the country, what Hog and Truffles are capable of producing. The website helps to show the different styles of food that can be produced. 
The idea is that people fill out the 'Get Quote' section, which will allow a quick and easy quote, to the potential customer. 

UX

Who is the website created for?
The website is created to help showcase the work that Hog and Truffles can complete. The Website shows that they do not just do one type of food but whatever the customer may need. The easy quote form, privides a link for Hog and Truffles to get back and discuss any needs that a customer may querie, along with a price.
Who does the website target?
The target audience is anyone, within a drivable distannce of South Wales. People who are looking for a cattering agency, to provide Buffets, Canopes and Wedding meals.
The website helps the users to easily show, using images, what has previously been produced in the past. The user wants a short form to fill out, to get a quote for their future event. 
The social media lnks at the bottom, help to find more information about the company. For instance, they could click on the facebook link, to find reviews and more live information. 
What is the plan for the website?
To bring as many customers, which originally would not know about Hog and Truffles. 

Demographic
Hog and Truffles aim to work many many types of demographoc. Ranging from parents, for childrens Birthday parties, to wedding, to Birthdays. The age range therefore would be from 18-100 years of age! Because of the vast ages that hog and truffles apeal to, the website has been made to be as simple and user friendly as possible. 

Scope
Some of the most important features of the site-

Navbar - The Navbar, links to all sections of the page. The navbar scrolls with the user, so can flick between sections as required. The hog and truffles logo, is found in the far left of navbar, to help show which site they are on and provide greater brand awareness.

Opening Image and logo - The opening image is full of color and shows what Hog and Truffles are about! The large logo, helps proivide brand awareness.

About us section - This section Shows the founders of Hog and Truffles. The image of them both smiling, with some of their own produced dishes, shows the enjoyment and passion that they bring to the table. This helps customers to connect with the company on a personal level.  
The information provided, shows where they have come from and where they are now. Again, helps to provide the future customers, of how the founders brains tick!

Gallery - Shows 3 different types of menus that are provided. 
click 1 of the 3, a different gallary is shown below. Very easy to use and showcases different types of food with ease.

Wireframes

Responsiveness
The Website has been made so it respondes to different device sizes.
To do this, Bootstrap was used to allow different grid systems to change for optimal user experience. 
MD Bootstrap was used to show the Gallery section, using a grid system. The Bootstrap order class is used to change the layout, depending on what size device is been used. 
When a smaller device is used, the website responds to this all the way through-
The navigation bar turns into a dropdown menu, so the top row is not squashed togther.
The image in 'About us' Is made smaller and is above the txt, instead of next to wehn in desktop scvreen size mode.
Our Promise section, turns into 1 box instead of 3 boxes horizontaly. This allows an easier read.
The Gallery turns into 1 page horizontaly also, when a smaller mobile screen size is used.

Design -

Design of the sight - The design of the sight is made to be colorful and eye catching, just like the food. I have tryed to use the same color pallet throughout the sight. I used HTML Color Picker, on W3schools.com. This has helped to keep the same pallet of colors throughout. 


Features

Technologies used

Testing
For testing writeup there are basically 5 parts.
1) List the websites you used to validate your code and what they are for.
2) Go through the user stories you wrote in the UX part of your readme, and explain how your website meets those needs.
3) Write about how each part of your responsive website behaves on different screen sizes.
And if you want to knock the grade for testing all the way up to the max:
4) Manually go though every part of your site and write out how you confirmed that each link, hover effect and other interactive parts of the site work as you expect.
5) List any bugs you came across while creating the site and while testing it. Include the fixes you came up with. (I have two sections here, one for fixed bugs and one for bugs I have not found a solution for yet.)
You can find more tips for your milestone in the pinned posts of this channel. Click the :pushpin: at the top of the #user-centric-frontend channel to find them all! The pinned PDFs are also stuffed with tips and advice too.

Deployment
:star: What does deployment mean and how do you write it up in your readme.md? :star:
In your first milestone (and future ones) there are 5 whole points out of 100 awarded for your deployment write up. But a lot of new students don't really get what that means, and so their writeup misses out on points that are actually very easy to get.
Deployment means what you did to make your website live and working for other people to look at.
Deployment is NOT pushing from GitPod to GitHub, and it is not the preview that GitPod gives you to view your working code.
For the first two of milestones Deployment is getting your site working on GitHub pages (It gets a lot more complex in the last two milestones!)
So when you come to deploy your site to github pages, you need to take a few steps to do that in the github settings. How to do that can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages
You need to include these steps in your readme on how it was deployed.
Basically explain to another developer who might work on your code, how you got the page up and running. (Later in the course the deployment section will get more complex, but if you want the best marks be pedantic and write it out in your readme this time too!)
Also, deployment includes writing up how to run your code locally. So explain how to pull your code from your github repository (you don't need to give any passwords) so someone could clone your code to work on on their own machine. Here is how to do that: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository Include these steps in your readme.md too and that's the deployment section of your readme sorted. (edited)
