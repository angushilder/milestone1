Hog and Truffles

This website was produced to help a small trading company called Hog and Truffles". They are located near Cardiff, in Wales. The site has been set up, to help show the rest of the country, what Hog and Truffles are capable of doing. The website helps to show the different style of food. The idea is that people fill out the 'Get Quote' section, which will allow a quick and easy quote, to the potential customer.

Testing
For testing writeup there are basically 5 parts.
1) List the websites you used to validate your code and what they are for.
2) Go through the user stories you wrote in the UX part of your readme, and explain how your website meets those needs.
3) Write about how each part of your responsive website behaves on different screen sizes.
And if you want to knock the grade for testing all the way up to the max:
4) Manually go though every part of your site and write out how you confirmed that each link, hover effect and other interactive parts of the site work as you expect.
5) List any bugs you came across while creating the site and while testing it. Include the fixes you came up with. (I have two sections here, one for fixed bugs and one for bugs I have not found a solution for yet.)
You can find more tips for your milestone in the pinned posts of this channel. Click the :pushpin: at the top of the #user-centric-frontend channel to find them all! The pinned PDFs are also stuffed with tips and advice too.
